### **INTRODUCTION**
> _This Python program implements the Vigenère Cipher, which uses a keyword to encrypt alphabetic text by means of a sequence of interwoven Caesar ciphers. After entering a message and key, the program encrypts the message utilizing the Vigenère Cipher and displays the ciphertext._ 

### **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED**
> Python

## **Attributes**
- > **Encrypts messages** using the algorithm known as the Vigenère Cipher.
- > Gives the user the opportunity to **enter both a message and a key.**
- > This function encrypts the data using the key by **converting it to numerical numbers.**
- > Those non-alphabetic characters from **the original string are preserved.**
- > This function **adds up the entire amount of letters in the key** **and then calculates** the result modulo 26.
- > Proceeds to **iterate through the key several times** till the end of the message.
- > **displays the ciphertext** that was generated.
- > Contains a **greeting message** and **inquires about the user's name before continuing.**
- > It puts the **decision to continue or leave** in the hands of the user.
- > Displays ASCII art with the use of the **pyfiglet module.**

## **How to run this program using IDE?**
> 1. Launch an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) program like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
> 2. A new Python file needs to be created, and then the code needs to be copied into it.
> 3. You should use the.py extension when saving the file.
> 4. You can start the program by either selecting the Run button from the toolbar or pressing the F5 key on your keyboard.
> 5. To enter your message and key, simply follow the on-screen prompts.
>6.  Following the successful encryption of your communication, the program will show you the ciphertext that was produced.
> 7. When prompted, you will be able to choose whether to continue or quit by entering "yes" or "no."
> 8. When requested to continue or exit the program's window, entering 'no' will cause the program to close.
