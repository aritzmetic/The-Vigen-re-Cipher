# Delera, Aritz B.
# The Vigenere Code Cipher

# Define a class for Vigenere Cipher
# create a dictionary to change the alphabets to numbers
# convert the key to numerical values
# Add the character to the ciphertext without encrypting it if it is not an alphabet.
# Determine each letter's numerical value in the message.
# Calculate the result modulo 26 by adding the total number of the alphabet in the key.
# Add the alphabet to the ciphertext after converting the encrypted numerical value to a alphabet.
# Move to the next alphabet in the key.
# Use while loop for a condition-controlled loop
# Ask the name of the user to create a greeting
# ask the user to input the message and key
# Create an instance of VigenereCipher class and encrypt the message using the key
# Display the encrypted message
# Ask the user if they want to continue or exit
